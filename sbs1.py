'''
Receive and process data about airplane trajectories in SBS-1 (BaseStation) format.

The data format is documented here:
http://woodair.net/sbs/article/barebones42_socket_data.htm

Live data about aircraft near you can be generated from an ADS-B receiver and dump1090:
https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build/
https://github.com/antirez/dump1090

Liveish data about satellites overhead can be generated in the same format by
satellites.py. The software will just assume that they are very fast, very high
altitude airplanes.

Though there are a number of supporting classes and functions, the star of the show
here is Sbs1Receiver. You just tell it where you are and what servers to receive data
from, and then call get_planes() to get a dict of Airplane objects, organized by their
Aircraft Mode S hexadecimal code (hex code). The Airplane objects store the last known
position of the aircraft, and a function that lets you extrapolate that position into
the future based on its last known velocity.
