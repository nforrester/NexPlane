'''I couldn't find a low latency Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library on the internet (shocking, I know!), so I wrote one myself.

It sends commands and replies as UDP packets.
Each packet is sent in triplicate to protect against dropped packets.
If a response is not received promptly, the data is sent again
(though after trying for long enough it will time out).
Message and client IDs are employed to ensure that each command is executed at most once on the server,
even though the command may be received several times, and the reply may be sent several times.

    We need to detect duplicate messages so we can ignore them. Message IDs come
    mostly sequentially, but can arrive slightly out of order. We can't just
    keep track of the last message ID received and reject all IDs less than that
    because they might come out of order. We also can't just keep an ever-growing
    set of IDs we've seen because that would be a huge memory leak.

    To solve this we store the received message IDs in both a set and a heap.
    The set is for fast lookup of individual IDs. The heap is to keep track of
    the maximum ID for which we know that all lesser IDs have been observed.
    Upon receiving a new ID we can then start by checking the heap, then checking
    the set. When the lowest and second lowest IDs currently stored are adjacent
    we can then remove the lowest to keep memory usage from growing.
